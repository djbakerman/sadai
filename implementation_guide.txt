```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure the System

The system needs to be configured with your Graylog API credentials and other settings:

```bash
# Initial run will create a default config.yaml
python -m main

# Edit the configuration file with your settings
# nano config.yaml
```

Key settings to update in `config.yaml`:
- `graylog.api_url`: Your Graylog API URL
- `graylog.api_key`: Your Graylog API key
- `alerts.email`: Configure email alert settings

### 3. Test the Base System

Before implementing RL, test the base anomaly detection system:

```bash
# Test with sample data
python -m examples --test

# Run a single detection cycle
python -m main
```

### 4. Train the RL Model

Train the reinforcement learning model using simulation:

```bash
# Train with 100 simulated episodes
python -m rl_main --simulate --episodes 100
```

The simulation will create several plots in the `./results/` directory to visualize the learning process.

### 5. Analyze RL Performance

Analyze the RL model's performance:

```bash
# Run the analysis tool
python -m rl_analysis --model-path ./rl_model --output-dir ./results
```

Review the performance metrics to ensure the model is learning effectively.

### 6. Deploy the RL-Enhanced System

Once satisfied with the RL model's performance, deploy the RL-enhanced system:

```bash
# Run with automatic feedback
python -m rl_main --run --feedback auto

# OR run with manual feedback (interactive)
python -m rl_main --run --feedback manual
```

## Learning Process Stages

The system's learning process occurs in several stages:

### Stage 1: Initial ML Model Learning
1. First events establish baseline clusters
2. K-Means and InfoNCE models begin to identify patterns
3. Initial anomaly detection uses a fixed threshold

### Stage 2: RL Threshold Optimization
1. RL model begins with high exploration (trying different thresholds)
2. Feedback updates Q-values for different thresholds
3. System gradually favors thresholds with higher rewards

### Stage 3: Mature Operation
1. ML models have stable clusters representing normal patterns
2. RL model has converged to an optimal threshold
3. System accurately detects anomalies with minimal false positives/negatives

## Performance Tuning

### ML Model Parameters
- `embedding_dim`: Increase for more complex log patterns
- `num_clusters`: Adjust based on the variety of normal events

### RL Model Parameters
- `threshold_min/max`: Adjust the range of possible thresholds
- `num_thresholds`: Number of discrete threshold values to consider
- `epsilon_decay`: Controls exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Analysis
Run the analysis tool periodically to monitor the RL model's performance:

```bash
python -m rl_analysis
```

### Retraining
If system behavior changes significantly, retrain the RL model:

```bash
# Reset and retrain from scratch
rm -rf ./rl_model/*
python -m rl_main --simulate --episodes 200
```

### Backup
Regularly backup the model and database directories:

```bash
# Example backup command
tar -czf backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ./model ./rl_model ./embeddings_db
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High False Positive Rate**
   - Increase the initial anomaly threshold
   - Train the RL model with more episodes
   - Ensure ML models have processed enough events to establish baselines

2. **Missing Real Anomalies**
   - Lower the initial anomaly threshold
   - Adjust the RL reward function to penalize false negatives more heavily

3. **Slow Learning**
   - Increase the learning rate (`alpha`)
   - Adjust the discount factor (`gamma`)
   - Train with more episodes or real-world data

4. **Database Growth**
   - Adjust `max_age_days` in the database configuration
   - Implement regular pruning of old embeddings
